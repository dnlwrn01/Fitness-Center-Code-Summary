## Intro
This project is a dynamic website template written in HTML/CSS/JS integrated into concrete5 (at client request) using PHP. Application utilizes 3 api's: Google Maps, Gym Master, & ScheduleOnce. Additionally, there was work needed server-side to produce a valid SSL certificate, setup Apache2 for hosting, and point nameservers to new IP address.

## Font-End
The front-end was a bit complicated due to the use of an older technology, however, the styling was done using MDBootStrap and JavaScript. These compoents were rendered using PHP template tags.

## Back-End
The back-end of this site is the concrete5 CMS that has been customized to fit this particular clients needs.

## Solution


## Retrospective
Overall, this project was a win. I solved the main problem for the client with their requested software and provided a better customer experience for each user. With that being said, There are a number of this that I would approach differently in the future. 

Mainly, the CMS concrete5 is a) not very user friendly and b) is too bulky. This application could have been greatly improved with a custom back-end, but the client wanted a software that they understood and felt comfortable with. After explaining the compromise in proformance and capabilities, I proceeded to develop the project.  As an SMB Owner managing a website on their own, I respect wanting familiarity for editing in the future but I wanted the client to understand that limitations of their application.
